In this student's project, I answered business questions for fictional movie rental company Rockbuster.

I provided data-driven answers to help them dor their company strategy, using SQL queries to draw insights from the database.

The database contains information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, locations, customers, and payments.

The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.
